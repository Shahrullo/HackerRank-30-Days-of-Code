# HackerRank-30-Days-of-Code
HackerRank's [30 Days of Code challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=30-days-of-code) using Python 3.

I started 30 Days Code challenge to brush up my Python coding skills during the winter vacation. I admit some of them are really easy but I want to be consistent and decided to finish it. Even if the challenge is based on Java, It is possible to make it in Python. Topics include if-else statements, recursion, data structures and more.

I didn't write README for each task. The description of the problems are given inside the code with comments
